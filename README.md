# [Getting to Philosophy](https://ericwindmill.github.io/philosphy_finder/)
Getting to Philosophy is a Wikipedia web crawler that will count and record the steps it takes to get to Philsophy.

According to Wikipedia: "Clicking on the first link in the main text of a Wikipedia article, and then repeating the process for subsequent articles, will usually lead to the Philosophy article. As of February 2016, 97% of all articles in Wikipedia eventually lead to the article Philosophy."

This application automates that process.
